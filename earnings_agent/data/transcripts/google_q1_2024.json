Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to GOOGLE's first quarter 2025 earnings conference call.\n        \n        With me on today's call are John Doe, Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Johnson, Chief Financial Officer.\n        \n        Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties.\n        \n        Now, I'll turn the call over to John.\n        \n        John Doe: Thank you, Jane, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report a strong start to fiscal year 2025, with first quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year.\n        \n        Our performance this quarter demonstrates the continued execution of our strategic initiatives and the robust demand for our products and services.\n        \n        Our new product line exceeded expectations, contributing $2.1 billion in revenue, a 25% increase from last quarter.\n        \n        We're also seeing strong momentum in our international markets, with revenue growing 18% year-over-year.\n        \n        Now, I'll turn it over to Bob to discuss our financial results in more detail.\n        \n        Bob Johnson: Thanks, John. As John mentioned, total revenue for the first quarter was $10.5 billion, a 15% increase from the prior year.\n        \n        Gross margin was 55%, up 200 basis points from last year, driven by product mix and manufacturing efficiencies.\n        \n        Operating expenses were $3.2 billion, representing 30% of revenue, compared to 32% last year.\n        \n        Net income was $2.1 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $1.05, up 20% year-over-year.\n        \n        Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $15 billion in cash and investments, and generated $3 billion in operating cash flow.\n        \n        Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect revenue between $10.8 billion and $11.2 billion, and EPS between $1.10 and $1.15.\n        \n        For the full year 2025, we are raising our guidance, with revenue now expected between $44 billion and $45 billion, and EPS between $4.50 and $4.70.\n        \n        With that, I'll turn it back to John for closing remarks.\n        \n        John Doe: Thanks, Bob. In conclusion, we're very pleased with our start to 2025 and remain confident in our ability to execute on our strategic priorities.\n        \n        We're now ready to take your questions. Operator?\n        \n        Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sarah Williams with XYZ Securities.\n        \n        Sarah Williams: Thanks for taking my question. Can you provide more color on the performance of your new product line and your expectations for the rest of the year?\n        \n        John Doe: Sure, Sarah. As I mentioned, our new product line performed exceptionally well this quarter, with revenue of $2.1 billion. Customer feedback has been very positive, and we're seeing strong adoption rates across all our key markets.\n        \n        Based on current trends, we expect this momentum to continue, with the new product line potentially contributing around 25% of our total revenue for the full year.\n        \n        Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Brown with ABC Investments.\n        \n        Michael Brown: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Could you discuss the impact of recent supply chain challenges on your business, and what steps you're taking to mitigate any issues?\n        \n        John Doe: That's a great question, Michael. Like many in our industry, we've experienced some supply chain constraints, particularly for certain components.\n        \n        However, we've been proactive in diversifying our supplier base and have built up strategic inventory for critical components.\n        \n        As a result, the impact on our business has been relatively minimal, though we continue to monitor the situation closely.\n        \n        Bob Johnson: And if I could add to that, Michael, we've factored these considerations into our guidance for the year, so we believe we're well-positioned despite these challenges.\n        \n        Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jane Smith for any closing remarks.\n        \n        Jane Smith: Thank you, operator. Thank you all for joining us today. This concludes our earnings call. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\n        "}
